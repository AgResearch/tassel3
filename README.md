TASSEL is a software package to evaluate traits associations, evolutionary patterns, and linkage disequilibrium. Strengths of this software:

1. It provides a number of new and powerful statistical approaches to association mapping such as a General Linear Model (GLM) and Mixed Linear Model (MLM). MLM is an implementation of the technique which our recently published Nature Genetics paper - [Unified Mixed-Model Method for Association Mapping](https://tassel.bitbucket.io/unified-mixed-model) - which reduces Type I error in association mapping with complex pedigrees, families, founding effects and population structure.

2. Ability to handle a wide range of indels (insertion & deletions). Most software package ignore this type of polymorphism, however, in some species (like maize) this is the most common type of polymorphism.

TASSEL 3 is no longer being developed by its creators.  This repo contains minor changes for the version in use at AgResearch.
